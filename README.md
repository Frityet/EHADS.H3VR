# EHADS.H3VR

Enhanced Health and Damage System (EHADS) for H3VR, based of the Ravenfield mod with the same name

## Planned Features

- Fall Damage
    - The player can no longer jump incredible heights without dying
    - Parachutes to soften the fall
    
- Bleeding
    - Damage to the player causes *bleeding* to body parts
    - Use bandages, MedKits, Morphine, Painkillers to heal
    - Shot? Have a quick adrenalin rush and sprint out of there! You can extend this effect with adrenalin syringes, but be warned, take too much and die 

- Realistic Movement
    - No more MEGA jump
    - Stamina
        - Your stamina bar will slowly run out the more you move
        - What you are carrying will also effect this
        - No stamina? Slow movement
