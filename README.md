# EHADS.H3VR

Enhanced Health and Damage System (EHADS) for H3VR, based of the Ravenfield mod with the same name

## Planned Features

- Fall Damage
    - The player can no longer jump incredible heights without dying
    - Parachutes to soften the fall
    
- Bleeding
    - Damage to the player causes *bleeding* to body parts
    - Use bandages, MedKits, Morphine, etc to heal
    - Heat
        - As you bleed, you get colder
        - Use warmers to warm up!

- Realistic Movement
    - No more MEGA jump
    - Stamina
        - Your stamina bar will slowly run out the more you move
        - What you are carrying will also effect this
        - No stamina? Slow movement
    
- Hunger
    - Moving makes you hungry! Eat foods to increase stamina and health regeneration
    - Carry around foods with different calories and effects
    - Make sure to drink lots of liquids!
